<h2>2. CSS</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets" title="CSS" target="_blank">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML.<br>
CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
</P>
<p>
CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.<br>
This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics,<br>
enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.
</p>
<p>
Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods,<br>
such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices.<br>
CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.
</p>
<p>
The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element.<br>
This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
</p>
<p>
The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). <br>
Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998).<br>
The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.
</p>
<p>
In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.
