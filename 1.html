<h2>1. HTML</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" title="HTML" target="_blank"><u> Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</u></a> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.<br> With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.
</p>
<p>
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.<br>
HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.<br>

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.<br> HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.<br>
HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <code class="mw-highlight" id="" style="" dir="ltr"><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">img</span> <span class="p">/&gt;</span></code> and <code class="mw-highlight" id="" style="" dir="ltr"><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">input</span> <span class="p">/&gt;</span></code> directly introduce content into the page.<br>
Other tags such as <code class="mw-highlight" id="" style="" dir="ltr"><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">&gt;</span></code> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.<br>
Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
</p>
<p>
HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages.<br>
Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, <br>
has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.
