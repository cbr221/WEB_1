<h2>3. JavaScript</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" title="JavaScript" target="_blank">JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),</a> often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.<br>
JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
</p>
<p>
Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.<br>
JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.<br>
The vast majority of websites use it, and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
</p>
<p>
As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles.<br>
It has APIs for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O,<br>
such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. It relies upon the host environment in which it is embedded to provide these features.
</p>
<p>
Initially only implemented client-side in web browsers, JavaScript engines are now embedded in many other types of host software,<br>
including server-side in web servers and databases, and in non-web programs such as word processors and PDF software, <br>
and in runtime environments that make JavaScript available for writing mobile and desktop applications, including desktop widgets.
</p>
<p>
The terms Vanilla JavaScript and Vanilla JS refer to JavaScript not extended by any frameworks or additional libraries.<br>
Scripts written in Vanilla JS are plain JavaScript code.
</p>
Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries,<br>
the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design. JavaScript was influenced by programming languages such as Self and Scheme.
