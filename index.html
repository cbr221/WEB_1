<u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" title="World Wide Web" target="_blank">The World Wide Web (WWW)</a></u>, commonly known as the Web, is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators.<br>
which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.<br>
The resources of the WWW may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser.
</p>
<p>
English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser in 1990 while employed at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland.<br>
The browser was released outside CERN in 1991, first to other research institutions starting in January 1991 and then to the general public in August 1991.<br>
The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet.<br>
</p>
<p>
Web resources may be any type of downloaded media, but web pages are hypertext media that have been formatted in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).<br>
Such formatting allows for embedded hyperlinks that contain URLs and permit users to navigate to other web resources.<br>
In addition to text, web pages may contain images, video, audio, and software components that are rendered in the user's web browser as coherent pages of multimedia content.
</p>
<p>
Multiple web resources with a common theme, a common domain name, or both, make up a website. <br>
Websites are stored in computers that are running a program called a web server that responds to requests made over the Internet from web browsers running on a user's computer.<br>
Website content can be largely provided by a publisher, or interactively where users contribute content or the content depends upon the users or their actions.<br>
Websites may be provided for a myriad of informative, entertainment, commercial, governmental, or non-governmental reasons.
